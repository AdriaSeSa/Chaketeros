# Project Description

This is a student project from the UPC university on the Video Games Design and Development degree at CITM, Terrassa. Our group, Chaketeros, formed by Zhida Chen, Robert Recordà, Pol Rius and Adrià Sellarés, is responsible for creating a tribute to the Mega Bomberman video game (1994) for the Sega Genesis. This tribute has been made using the SDL library and C++ on Visual Studio. All assets used on this project are not of our own, but from the original game. This is a nonprofit project.


# Game Description

Mega Bomberman is an Action and Maze game developed by Westone. It was originally named Bomberman'94, developed by Hudson Soft for the PC-Engine in 1993, but got re-developed in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. It is recognized as one of the most iconic games of the Bomberman saga.

In the game, the player is placed on different stages where he must destroy two or more pillars to advance. To do so, you have to use bombs to overcome several enemies and obstacles, and get to your objective. But watch out! The bombs can hurt you, as well as the enemies. There are multiple power-ups as well that you can use to change the game rules, but you mut be lucky to get them. After three or more stages, you get to fight the area Boss, a different and more strong enemy that will test your skills at their peak.
